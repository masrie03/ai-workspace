# Linear Regression

## Definition
Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable y
and one or more independent variables X by fitting a linear equation.

## When to Use
- Relationship is approximately linear
- Continuous target variable
- Interpretability is important

## Mathematical Form
y = wX + b

## Key Assumptions
- Linearity
- Independence
- Homoscedasticity
- No multicollinearity

## Common Pitfalls
- Outliers affecting the fit
- Using linear regression for non-linear data
- Multicollinearity between features

## Python Pattern
- sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression
- train_test_split
- Mean Squared Error
